#### Hello Team, I appreciate your time and consideration for the opportunity ! This is the front end for assignment.
## It is imperative that the node server is turned on first before starting this application

#### Do this by opening a terminal within the node_backend directory and using `npm start`

#### the React application is listening to port 3100

### Make sure to install dependencies using `npm install` 

### To start use `npm start`

#### This will start the application at localhost:3000

### You can also run `npm test` to run the tests I created

#### Please Reach out with any questions !! Best GT (:
